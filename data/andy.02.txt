{speak_outloud}I: BeforeI give you the second prompt, do you mind telling me what your though process was.


P: {att>blame_self}Yes, sorry. I thought it wasýÿ I guess I have a slightly weird way of speaking. I understood it didnýÿt quite gras that I was asking to change the title at the end. It just tagged it on to the title that I was changing. It didnýÿt quite understand what I was asking. I guess the right format would have been ýÿChange ***ýÿ and not say it is the title.
{/att>blame_self}

I: How did you figure it out?

P: Well when I set it the way that I set it, it came back and said, ýÿSorry but there is no event title blah blah blahýÿ and it said title at the end. Then it clicked, I shouldnýÿt be saying the title at the end I shouldnýÿt even refer to the title I should say the actual thing and have it change that way.

I: Ok and what about changing the location you had about three event to do that.

P: It was the same thing as the title. Oh I canýÿt say location because its going to add location to the actual, so I just need to say the location or whereýÿs it at and change it that way.

I: OK. Alright.{/speak_outloud}

**FOURTH PROMPT***



P: {obstacle>unfamiliar_commands}(add) guess (guests) for events{/obstacle>unfamiliar_commands}

DC: Sorry but there is no event titled, Òguess for events.Ó Please try again.

P: {speak_outloud}I dont know, I, I guess it cuts out that middle man. Of like, asking for a speicifc event.
Instead of asking for guess you are suppose to say, ýÿHey add these people.ýÿ And it will automatically add them as guests. And so, thatýÿs what I should have done. Used common sense there. {/speak_outloud}

BEGIN Q&A
ýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿ


I: All right. Okay, before we let you go, just a couple of quick questions. Remember what we discussed last week, was what do you think ... What systems capabilities this time around?

P: I thought it was ... They were improved upon which is nice and that with the weekly format it expanded a lot of things. I think it just needs a tiny bit of fine tuning with that. When you have weekly, it should be able to recognize that when you're saying, "{nlp_want_more}Weekly," you mean the timeframe that's you're scheduling it for, not that, that's the title.
{/nlp_want_more}

I: Okay.

P: Of the thing. Also, when it came to adding people, I know it makes sense for the logic of the system to do the event first and then add the people. The only thing is that grammatically that fits a little weird because you're going event first and then you're inviting {att>incorrect_mental_model} but I understand that, that's just a lot to get the system. That's how it has to run it.

I: Okay, and what would you say changed in terms of your understanding of voice interviews as a general without losin{/att>incorrect_mental_model} There wasn't a whole lot that changed, honestly.{distrust_NLP} I've kept the same thing where it's a great new, blooming technology, but it still has it's little kinks like, "N," and "M," sounds are a little weird for it.{/distrust_NLP}

I: Would you say that after you interact with DiscoverCal, would you say that you would be more comfortable or less comfortable interacting with the different voice interface?

P: {assimilation_bias}Iýÿd probably be more comfortable just because it's ... These voice interfaces are like riding a bike. You're just changing bikes. If you understand one, you understand the basics of every one so you can use it to some degree of success.{/assimilation_bias}

I: Okay. That's really helpful. Also ... Yeah, I think that's all I have to ask you. I'll send you on your way.

P: Okay.

I: Yeah, you can stop.

P: Okay.

I: Again, if I was to ask you to, say, quantify on a scale of one to five, whether you agree strongly or disagree with it, would you say that you are now more comfortable with interacting with the voice interface? Or sorry-

P: This specific voice interface or ...

I: Well, let's just ... Let me rephrase that. Just say you ... Do you feel comfortable interacting with voice interface in general on a scale of one to five after, say, your first session. What would be your rank with that and after this session what would be rank with that?

P: Before it was a three or four. I was pretty comfortable with the ideas. Afterwards it's definitely a confident four, even possibly a five. It's nice to have almost this informal training as it were for voice interface, but I don't know. I understood the technologies and I understand their benefits. I think it's really cool to expand upon it.

I: All right. Okay, that's really helpful. Thank you so much for your help.

P: Awesome.

I: Thank you, Andy.
