BEGIN Q&A

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½


I: Okay. So, based on your session today, what did you think that the system was capable of doing anything that knew that you learned that it was capable of doing that you didn't know last session?

P: I learned that it's capable of adding guests to a function, or something.

I: Okay. All right. And what about limitations? Anything else that you, like, noticed that you didn't know about last time?

P: The left menu didn't fill me in on how to like, work with reoccurring events and that was a curiosity of mine, because I wanted to set it to reoccur on Tuesdays, and I didn't know if for sure if I did or I didn't set it to- I'm pretty sure I didn't. That was my lack of confidence in whether or not I completed the task. I wasn't sure if I invited both John Smith and Kelly Nelson.

I: Okay. All right, so based on your interaction today, what was your approach? How did you approach the interface to complete your tasks.

P: {menu_usage}Read, Read left menu. First decide what I was gonna say, and then start trying.{/menu_usage}

I: Okay, and how was, how was that different from your approach last week? 

P: {att>assimilation_bias}Last week I was kind of just going off based of what I've been used to before. But now, I've kind of readjusted myself to use these new commands and I'm sure once I've memorized this, I can É{/att>assimilation_bias}{att>learning_system}{/att>learning_system}

I: Okay. All right, so you said, "Once I memorize the commands." What- How would that help in getting that you would still need to use the Left Menu as much?

P: It- I would not- If I got some more useful ones memorized, I would only use it when I forget one, or something like that. It would be become less useful but reassuring that it's there, you know? Like, how I could always refer back to it. That sort of thing.

I: Okay, and, sorry. And what about sort of your insight of how to discover categories? Did that change in any way or is it just the same? And did it perform as you'd expect it to this session?

P: The check pad didn't, the discover kind of, but the check pad was a little cumbersome today.

I: Okay, yeah, we'll try to take that out.

P: It still had some issues.

I: All right, and so, and you thought it was similar, and do you think this is mapped in any way in understanding voice interaction in general and do you have and any other comments about DiscoverCal?
