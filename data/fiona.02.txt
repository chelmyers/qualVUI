END OF TASK

BEGIN Q&A

�������������


I: So before I let you go, just a couple of quick questions. So what did you think of from today compared to last week if there was anything in the system that you learned how to do that you didn't know about before?

P: I feel like ... I{mental_model_hard}{att>incorrect_mental_model} thought that doing it again and doing it more would be easier, and I would figure out what I needed to say but that didn't really happen.{/att>incorrect_mental_model}{/mental_model_hard} {att>frustrated}I feel like I got worse with what I had to do. {/att>frustrated}{learn_command}I did figure out ... I saw, you could just say yes, when he that's all. So, yeah, I got that down.{/learn_command} With changing from one Tuesday to every Tuesday, I had an issue with that, so I had to go out of it and go back in for it to know what to do.

I: Okay. So when yo said that you figured out that you could say yes, was that something that you didn't see last time or was it something that you just-

P: {menu_usage}Yeah it was in the menu, I just didn't see it.{/menu_usage}

I: You didn't see it, okay. So what did you think of the system that didn't do well this time around or something that you felt that you thought was a limitation of the interface compared to last time?

P: Yeah changing it from the one Tuesday to several Tuesdays. That seemed limited because you needed it right at the beginning, for it to know what to do. {obstacle>system_bug}Putting attendees in, I was trying to follow the menu but it didn't seem to work, okay, also at one point it said, "Undefined John Smith," and I'm not sure why.{/obstacle>system_bug} 

I: Besides that, what would say from the first session until now is your understanding of the DiscoverCal works? 

P: {got_harder}Probably the same, maybe worse.{/got_harder} 

I: Okay.

P: Yeah I'm not ...

I: So how do you understand, or what are you understanding is the way the system is structured or how it functions?

P: {tactic>simplification}It definitely wants you to say the command and then the information.{/tactic>simplification} It's something about making what you say the title, I forget, because it was on the menu, but I followed it more closely and the first one I tried to give it, it didn't put in a title for me? {att>blame_self}I did it right that time.
{/att>blame_self}

I: Okay.

P: Yeah. But I did do it right the other times, I forget what I did. 

I: Besides that, from your interaction here, I know that you haven't had a lot of experience with voice interaction, so from your interaction from these two sessions, is there anything that has mapped you of your understanding of the way that voice interaction in general works, not just DiscoverCal?

P: {vui_inexperienced}I don't know, because I don't really use other ones so this is the only one I've used. {/vui_inexperienced}

I: Is there anything that you would like, say we give you tomorrow to interact with, is there something that you would use the knowledge from here to apply with that, or would you interact with completely differently? Would you take a different approach, or would it be the same approach?

P: {vui_same_approach}I would just take the same approach. {/vui_same_approach}

I: Which is?

P: {machine_language_fallback}Just saying what you want it to do and then the information, not the other way around.
{/machine_language_fallback}

{memo}**MEMO: Guessing changing from human convo to machine language as fallback. Maybe frustrated inexperienced user will ditch human falled too**
{/memo}

I: So that was your approach in this session, was that also the approach that you started off with or did you find yourself starting off with a different approach in session one? 

P: {user_dont_detect_change_in_approach}I think I used the same approach, because that's where it has the menu.{/user_dont_detect_change_in_approach} It will have the bolded part and then the other part. 

I: All right besides that, so compared to last session, how confident were you when you started out with DiscoverCal today and how were you when you ended?

P: I started really confident because I thought because I had used it before, I would have a better grasp of it, but by the end I realized I don't. So I'm a lot less confident now. 

I: Do you think that there is a system limitations that are causing that lack of confidence?

P: {distrust_NLP}{att>blame_nlp}Yeah, just because it needs really specific order of things and the way you're saying things. {/att>blame_nlp}{/distrust_NLP}

I: Is there anything else that you want to add? Any additional comments, anything about DiscoverCal, voice interaction, questions, concerns?

P: No, I'm still not sure if I actually did
