BEGIN Q&A

I: Before we end, I just have a couple of questions for you.

P: Gotcha.

I: After your experience with DiscoverCal, what did you think that the system was capable of doing?

P: It seemed like the system was capable of setting up basic date and time situations. It'd be interesting to see how it could progress further to add more options that you would see on a normal calendar. Like: set this event, this recurring event for this many times, or color-coding different events on the calendar so that ... being able to put them in the different categories because that's something I enjoy doing, is putting my things into categories so that I know, "Hey, this is red it has to be done. Hey, this is green it doesn't have to be done today, it can be done later." Prioritizing events. Or prioritizing things you put on the calendar.

{memo}**MEMO: is it benefical a lot of people critqued as a product and not a VUI Experiement?**{/memo}

I: Okay.

I: What about from the voice interface aspect? What did you think that the voice interface was capable of doing?

P: I felt like the voice interface was capable of doing a lot. If the basic prompts are given like they were there, the system could be really expanded on because the fact that it's just those basic one or two word prompts means that you could have it say a lot of different things and it seemed really good with things that I would think were a little more obscure. Like Haggerty Library.{att>faith_in_NLP}{faith_in_NLP} It struggled a little bit with some sounds that I will admit are similar, so the sound being more of a "F" or a "Ss". I understand that, though.{/faith_in_NLP}{/att>faith_in_NLP}

I: Okay. What did you think were the limitations of the system?

P: {att>blame_nlp}{distrust_NLP}The limitations is just, honestly, the same as any other voice interface that I've interacted with. It's just there are complex sounds in any language, and in English some of the harder ones are the "f" sound because the "F" sounds matches with so many other sound frequencies.{/distrust_NLP}{/att>blame_nlp}

I: Fair enough. As far as basing it off your prior experience with voice interfaces did the system perform as you expected it to?

P: Yeah. It performed I think a little better in my opinion, because I really liked having a basic prompt to it. {menu_useful}I really liked having all my options there, because if you're messing around with Cortana or Google, they just say "How can I help you?ýÿ{/menu_useful} They don't really give you actual things that you can say.{mental_model_from_menu} I liked having a set path that I could go because it made the chance of error that much less than if I was using Google or Cortana to do things. {/mental_model_from_menu}If I say something in Cortana like a colloquialism instead of an actual set thing, like if I say, "Hey Cortana. Set up a date, set up a meeting at this time, this date, blah-blah-blah." But what I'd probably say is "Hey Cortana, could you jot this down for me real quick? I need you to do this, this, and this." It probably won't get that. {menu_useful}This has a prompt that says, "Hey, you can say this for it to work," and I appreciate that.
{/menu_useful}

{memo}**MEMO: Enjoys have a clear path and can make a good mental model**{/memo}

I: Okay. How would you say that your interaction here contributed to your ... well, you kind of already answered that, but how it contributed to your general understanding of voice interfaces?

P: I mean it just ... just that this technology is new and it's fun, and there's a lot there already, but there's also a lot of room to grow. I think this is a nice step because it's a nice, simple system that introduces guidelines, which is something that I think that voice command had been missing; because voice command, when you say, "Hey Cortana," and she says, "How can I help?" And she doesn't give anything else besides that, you can feel kind of lost, because it's like, "Well, I want you to do this thing," but if you don't do it the way that I think it should be done, how else can I do it? This gives a really simple prompt so that it streamlines the process by introducing guidelines.

I: Okay. Have you used Siri?

P: I have not used Siri, no. My family's an android family.
