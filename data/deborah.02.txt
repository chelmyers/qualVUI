BEGIN Q&A

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½


I: Okay, so just based on your interaction, what did you think was your approach with the interface?

P:{menu_useful}{menu_usage} So I used the left side bar mostly in the main screen and ended up pop-up.{/menu_usage}{/menu_useful}

I: Okay.

P: And...

I: Did anything change from what you did last session?

P: I don't- Nothing changed specifically. I was more familiar with what was there.

I: Okay.

P: So it was more comfortable with the basic add and remove functions.

I: Okay. So based on your experience today, how would you say it went? Like how- what was your experience?

P: I think it was definitely more difficult to do more complex things with this interface, or there is no way to get help if you weren't sure how to do something.

I: Okay... Anything else?

P: I don't know- Sorry, what was the question?

I: Just like, I'm just asking what your general experience, but I mean...

P: Yeah, I don't know if there's anything specific that it was like, missing, but I just... couldn't... I just couldn't figure out how to do- How to change the one thing.

I: The end time.

P: Yeah, the end time, and I kind of just got stuck on that, and there was no way to, like, figure or like, figure out what was going on.

I: Okay. So based on your interaction today, how would you say you understand how DiscoverCal works? Is there anything different from your understanding of how it worked previous session?

P: Like, technically?

I: Mm-hmm (yes).

P: I don't... I don't think that there's any difference in how it worked.

I: Okay.

P: That's about it.

I: No, that's just your understanding. Did that change at all?

P: Oh, My understanding. So, I guess from just my experiences, easy to learn, like the basic things of how to add and delete an event.

I: Mm-hmm (yes) 

P: But, there is certain things- or like, if you're trying to do anything more complex, it was harder to figure it out.

I: Okay.

P: I don't know if I ment- Oh, I guess I mentioned the first time I tried to make the team project meeting, it wasn't recurring.

I: Mm-hmm (yes)

P: On the pop-up, but then I wasn't sure- I ended up canceling that anyway, but I wasn't sure how to turn that on.

I: Okay.

P: Once I was in there.

I: Okay. All right, besides that, like, how has this interaction in any way, if at all, sort of influence your understanding of how other voice interfaces work? Like, how they function maybe. You can say nothing. It's fine.

P: Yeah, I don't know if there is anythingÉ

I: Okay. All right, and besides that, is there anything else that you want to add about your understanding of- Was there anything new that you discovered that DiscoverCal is capable this session that you didn't know last session?

P: So, I guess I noticed the Invite People last session, but I didn't- I haven't used it before.

I: Mm-hmm (yes)

P: So, that was a new feature and I'd be interested in how, like how that work and integrate with your actual content.

I: Okay.

P: Like what it actually does when you say that.

I: Okay.

P: Also, I don't know if that was just the interface but, or I was actually only inviting one person at a time, it only showed one name at a time.

I: Okay.

P: So, I wasn't sure if they both went through.

I: Okay. All right, and any other comments? Anything else that you want to mention about your interaction? The session about DiscoverCal? Or anything to do with voice?

P: I don't know if this is relevant, but just a little thing that, when you say the titles, they're all lowercase.

I: Okay.

P: And like, personally that doesn't bother me, but they don't match the rest of the ones that were preset in there, so I don't know. I'm sure that's like a deliberate choice but.

I: Okay, it looks you came in handy.

P: Yeah.

I: All right, anything else?
