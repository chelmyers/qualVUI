P: All right.

I: Cool. Okay, so based on this session alone, what was your approach with [inaudible 00:00:08]?

{att>learning_system}P: So, this time I knew that there was this pre-made sentences, like here on the left. So every time I wanted to do something, I just looked for the sentence and I read it out loud by inserting the names or the dates of events in the fillers that I have there.{/att>learning_system}

I: Okay.

P: And I was much more successful than last time where I was trying to use freeform.

I: Okay. And has your understanding of the interface or your sort of understanding of how it functions changed at all? Or is it ...

P: I'm understanding much better now. There's still a couple of things that if I had this at home, I would be just experimenting with. Like for example, I noticed that I could set the end-time. And I didn't realize that. And there's no pattern here that are for end time, but that actually worked. So I wonder if other things would also work. So right now, if I was using this, I would experiment with things that worked and didn't work.

I: Okay. And so, did you think your approach changed significantly from last time? This time towards the end, you were doing ... Looking at the left menu and looking at-

P: Yeah. {quote}I’d say it change significantly. Like last time, I was just trying to use as if I could speak freely. And that didn't work. And this time I was using the template on the left, which basically worked and it was actually much easier.{/quote assimilatiob bias but learned system}

I: And did you notice anything new about the ... Like, anything new about what you could do with the interface that you may not have noticed last time?

P: Yeah, last time I left thinking that I could not change the end-time.

I: Okay.

P: And today I tried, and it actually worked.

I: Okay, anything else?

P: What else could I do? Well, this time ... There's new things I had to do, and last time I didn't realize I could do that. But it was just because I didn't have to do it, which is add participants…

I: Okay.

P: ... last time I didn't do it. And I wasn't systematic looking on the left menu last time. So maybe I had missed that last time.

I: Okay. And did the system perform as you expected it to?

P: Yeah, it actually worked much better today. It misunderstood a few words that I said, but I mean, I know they made it for American speakers. So I'm used to that.

I: Okay. And anything else you want to add about your interaction?

P: {blame_gui}Just, I have alrady said t this I think twice, so I don't know if better. I would like ... Whenever I do a change, when it goes back to the calendar, I would like that, like a little flash.{/blame_gui}

I: Some sort of animation?

P: Yeah.

I: Oh, okay.

P: Like a little flash. So it's, "Okay, that's what I added in."

I: Okay. 

P: Also the other thing is, so ... I mean, maybe it can't be done, so I don't know. I'm used to use the calendar in weekly-view, and this is monthly-view.

I: Okay.

P: So, only for myself I would like to say, "Change to weekly." I don't know if that can actually work. Like, maybe that can be done, yeah.

I: Okay. Cool. Anything else?

P: No, I think that's it.

I: All right. Awesome.
