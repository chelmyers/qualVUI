END OF TASK
ýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿ
BEGIN Q&A
ýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿ
I: All right, so a few follow up questions.
P: Mmm-hmm.
I: Some valuable stuff today from your sessions and thank you so much for sticking with everything.
P: No problem. [Laughs]
I: And seeing the way that you tried to overcome the obstacles is very valuable. I know ... I glad you didn't pull any of your hair out. We don't have that in our consent form, so thank you very much. Again, it seems to me it was a frustrating session, so ca you tell me what your new vision of what you think the capabilities and limitations are of DiscoverCal?
P: {inconsistent}I feel like it's just really inconsistentwith what you can say.{/inconsistent} {mental_model_hard}For example, I definitely would say,"Edit location", and then it would say, "What was the location?", and I'd answer it. {/mental_model_hard}That's what I was doing yesterday, and then the first one today. But for some reason that stopped working, so I just started saying, "Location is".
P: Then the left bar menu tells you to say one thing. It said ... {adaptive_mental_model_hard}The left bar menu options changed half way through. Not sure why. It said, {/adaptive_mental_model_hard}ýÿEdit/modify guest", so I was saying, "Edit/modify guest", but not realizing all I had to say was "Edit". I think I was assuming it was more complicated than it needed to be because in the past I tried to say, "Edit", and it didn't work.
I: Yeah.
P: Same with when I was trying to edit the time. I don't think I did anything different when it finally worked. It just all of a sudden on the 12th try it decided to work. I think it's just really inconsistent, and again the limitations are the ... It's not a natural ...
I: Yeah.
P: {natural_convo_desired}The voice commands don't come natural to a person.{/natural_convo_desired}
I: I have to applaud you on that.
P: You had to find me on that? I think it didn't hear me.
I: It did. It knew you were saying yes. That was really speaking your language right there.
P: I could kinda tell when it knew what I was saying right or wrong because, for example, when that time, I was saying "Guess", and it kept saying, "We don't know what ..."
P: Then when I said, "Guest", it didn't say, "We didn't know what that was", it said, "We don't have a thing for ..." It skipped over that, so it's like, "Okay, I guess that's how I have to say it."
I: That was fantastic.
P: Thank you.
I: A last question is, how did your interactions contribute to your understanding of the limitations of voice control, or the capabilities of voice control...?
P:{distrust_NLP} I think there needs to be a wider range of words that ... Language that it understands. Both in pronunciation, and then also different ways of saying things.{/distrust_NLP} Like if you say, "Edit this event", it should take you to the same spot if you just name the event. Which would take you to the same spot if you say, "Add these people to this event." It shouldn't ... Because there's such a specific order and way to say everything, there's no way that people can know that.
I: Yep.
P: If you are gonna have that, the left menu should be a lot more descriptive on literally say these words. I was trying to follow the left, and it obviously wasn't working.
I: Okay. All right, that's all that I have for you ...
