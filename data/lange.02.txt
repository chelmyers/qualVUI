BEGIN Q&A

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½



I: Before I let you go, I just have a couple of quick questions for you. So, based on your interaction today, what did you think that the system is now capable of doing that you didn't know before?

P: {att>blame_nlp}I noticed that whenever there are certain words that you have to pronounce, they tend to sound like other certain words that you would normally say but didn't mean.{/att>blame_nlp} So, it creates a ... And then, when you have to repeat it multiple times just to get that word, it would create aggravation. {att>frustrated}{/att>frustrated}

I: Okay. So, that's what you thought that the system was capable of doing this time, compared to previous times?

P: Yes, would say so. 

I: Okay. So, that's like a limitation of the interface. What would you say the system can do correctly, can do correct for you?

P: It does well in what you can do in regards to adding events and modifying events, deleting events, deleting people, adding people. However, while I believe that it does that well, there are, I think, bugs, that would have to be addressed-

I: Okay. So, let me rephrase. What did you know the system could do two days ago? Two days ago, when you tested the interface, what could the system do then that you knew that, "Okay, this is what DiscoverCal is capable of doing. I know DiscoverCal can do this?" What was that two days ago?

P: Recognizing your voice and phonetics in order to do its basic commands to add, to a calendar and modify your events, and add and delete. 

I: Okay. And what did you think it could do today?

P: I think it would be more of a ... It would act as a general calendar that one would abide by in order to organize their schedule. But instead of typing it in, it's completely voice command. 

I: Okay. So, that's something that you didn't know two days ago?

P: No. 

I: I'm just trying to understand if there's something today that you think the system could do that it couldn't do two days ago. If nothing, that's also fine. I'm just trying to understand if there's anything that you think the system could do today that two days ago it couldn't do. 

P: Oh. I don't believe so. 

I: Okay. That's basically all I was asking. Okay. So, besides that, did you think that it performed as you expected it to? 

P: Yeah, I did come in expecting the application to behave as expected two days ago. Yeah, I think that's it. 

I: Okay. So, I wasn't here last session, but can you tell me what your experience with voice interfaces or voice interaction is, in general?

P: I don't use voice interaction a lot, however, whenever I do use it I'm not ... Well, I am confident in using it. I just do not use frequently, however, due to efficiency, since-

I: So, what do you use?

P: I use just the touch-

I: No. I mean, which voice interface do you use?

P: {att>assimilation_bias}Oh. I would say Siri and Google. 
{/att>assimilation_bias}

I: Okay. And could you tell me a little bit about your approach when you do use those interfaces, and how that was different from your approach towards DiscoverCal in how you figured out what to do with the interface, like that approach?

P: So, you're asking about what's similar?

I: No, I'm asking about your approach with the voice interface. Like for example, if I was to come to a computer for the first time, my approach would be to start moving the mouse around. Or somebody else's approach might be to hit all the keyboards, right? 

P: Oh, okay. 

I: So, what is your approach with Siri and how is that different from your approach with DiscoverCal?

P: I can't say the same for both Siri and Google, however, I can say that with Siri I have to actually input with my finger. So, you know how you hold down a finger to just get Siri up? That's usually how I go about it. So, my first automatic sense is, "Okay, I have to touch something or apply something to the screen in order for it to activate." Other than that, I feel like, though, that if that doesn't work, then voice command, kind of like a wake-up call. 

I: Okay. What about your approach? Like, what about your ... How do I phrase this? What about the way that you interact with the interface, just like deciding what to say to Siri or deciding what to say to a Google system, or deciding what to say to DiscoverCal, what is your approach to figuring that out? 

P: Usually, I would just give a command to a voice assistant, like any other command I usually say to another person. However, if it's limited in its response, then I may have to switch around or rephrase my command in order to better phrase it right for the computer to realize. 

I: Okay. And how do you decide what to rephrase it to?

P: {quote}Usually, I find, if my first response wouldn't work, then I usually resort to just very basic keywords or very basic commands that would lead to other commands or other phrases and responses. {/quote simplifying}

I: Okay. And how was that different from the way that you interacted with DiscoverCal?

P: With DiscoverCal, what I did was usually ... I didn't have to form initial phrases in my head because the left menu there, it helps to guide me in my words, so that I don't always have to think of a command at first. But it serves as a starting point for what I want to do or what I want to command it to do, and then I can go on from there.

I: Okay, all right. And so, how would you say that your interaction with DiscoverCal is gonna change, if at all, the way that you do interact with other voice interfaces? Like, is there something about DiscoverCal that you have learned that you would apply to your interaction with, say, Siri or a Google system?

P: Since I could see through DiscoverCal's limitation in comparison other voice assistants, I would say that I would change my approach in that I would enunciate my words more clearly, so that the system would not miss-get my words. I'm not sure what that word is. 

I: That's just towards DiscoverCal? That's just your approach towards DiscoverCal that you would change? Or just any interface?

P: In any interface. 

I: In any interface, okay. Anything else that you would change, or is that it?

P: In regards to that question, or in general?

I: In general. Like, if you were to interact with Siri tomorrow, for example, or on Friday, would there be something different that you would think about or do after you've been through this process? Like, different from how you said that you normally just say any phrase that you would say to another person. If it doesn't understand you, then you resort to using keywords. So, if that's your approach towards Siri, is that gonna stay consistent even after this interaction?

P: Well, the way I see it is DiscoverCal and, for example, Siri are different in a way that you can be more personal with Siri, rather than DiscoverCal. DiscoverCal is very mechanical in its syntax. So, the way I would approach Siri, as opposed to DiscoverCal, since I know the essence of how they work, I would approach Siri the same way as I've always been, as opposed to DiscoverCal, since you can't really compare them as ... You can compare them as voice assistants, but you can't compare them as in how you can phrase words in order to better effectively communicate. 

I: Okay. You said right that you understand how they both work, their function. Can you elaborate a little bit about how you think they work?

P: So, I see that with DiscoverCal you would have these certain keywords that would enunciate response towards the audience. So, for example, you said the keywords that were listed on the left menu, then you would know the system would respond to you back as if you were talking to it. With Siri, however, you can say anything you want to it, and even, maybe mixing up words that you could say or that you could think of, and quite possibly you can get a response that you didn't expect. 

I: That you didn't expect?

P: Yes. 

I: Okay. And that's good?

P: Yes. It's creates unpredictability, so that it almost seems like you're talking to a person rather than DiscoverCal. 

I: Okay. So, you enjoy unpredictability in a voice interface if you're asking it to do things for you or-

P: When it comes  close to a commandv I would not expect unpredictability, I would expect that it does the command.

I:	Okay.

P:	Like DiscoverCal does well in. However, with Siri, you have much more flexibility in that. So-

I:	So, tell me ... 

P:	The effectiveness-

I:	So, what do you use, what do you use voice interaction for, usually?

P:	Usually-

I:	Like, when you've gone to Siri, what are you usually doing?

P:	... I would usually, like, find out information about current day, like weather-

I:	Okay.

P:	... and time.

I:	Okay, all right.  So, what happens if it gives you an unpredictable response in those things? What do you, how is your reaction to that?

P:	Sorry, I couldn't hear you.

I:	You said that it gives you an unpredictable response sometimes, right? So, like, when it gives you an unpredictable response, for weather, or time-

P:	Sometimes-

I:	... how do you usually respond to that?

P:	In the context of the unpredictability, I would mean, like, let's say you want to have fun with it, or something like that.

I:	Okay.

P:	When it comes to commands, though, I do expect a consistency in it.

I:	Okay.

P:	So, it's not just a voice assistant, but rather, a-

I:	Okay, so let's think about Siri, from not the just having fun with it perspective, from the perspective of the way that you relate to DiscoverCal. You said that with DiscoverCal, you have certain keywords, and you have to stick to those. With Siri, you can say anything you want to it. Do you maintain that stance if you're talking about commands with Siri?

P:	I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

I:	Do you maintain that stance, if you are talking with Siri about commands, things that you want it to do, like weather, time, things like that?

P:	I would agree. Yes.

I:	That you would just say whatever you want to it, okay. All right. Okay, besides that, that's pretty much all I have, I guess, for you. Is there anything that you want to add about DiscoverCal, about your understanding of voice interaction, voice interfaces in general, anything of that sort?
