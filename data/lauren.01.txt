BEGIN Q&A
ýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿýÿ
I: Awesome. So I do have a few questions for you. Actually, let me stop this. I guess we don't need a recorder. Data.
Okay, so some final questions for you. Based off of what you did say, what do you think DiscoverCal is capable of?
P: I think mostly just helping you manage your events. Kind of like what calendars do now, {vui_easier}but I guess in an easier way, you don't have to type things out.
{/vui_easier}
I: And what are the limitations of DiscoverCal?
P: {distrust_NLP}Well if you can't pronounce things well, I think that can be a huge thing for DiscoverCal, also if you have accents maybe, I'm not sure how that would pick it up.{/distrust_NLP}
I: Based off your tasks today, did the system perform as you expected it to?
P: I think so. I think it performed well. {confusion}I was a little confused on some parts.{/confusion} I was like, wait, how to go back. But, yeah.
I: What was the most confusing parts for you?
P: I think naming the events. I was like, "Oh, let's name the whole event." Instead of just the actual name and adding the date and time as the name of event.
I: Did you notice that it put the whole thing in the title?
P: Yeah, after I did it. I was like, "Wait." And then I was trying to read the whole title and it was like, oh.
I: Based off of your work today, has your understanding of voice control changed your mind?
P: No, I don't think so.
I: Just a question about your background. What major are you in right now?
P: Graphic design.
I: Graphic design, okay. Who's class are you in?
P: Eric's.
I: Oh okay.
P: Yeah. I'm like-
I: So here in CGI too? That's where a lot of our students are coming from. You have 3D graphic design here?
P: I'd like to be but-
I: How would you rate your technical expertise? Like-
P: In what-
I: Like how comfortable are you with using the latest technology?
P: Not too super-technical savvy. I can work my way around some things, but I'm not like super tech savvy kind of person.
I: Do you do any web development as a graphic designer?
P: Actually I'm learning about web and coding.
I: Yeah? Oh awesome. How do you like it?
P: It's a lot. It's a lot to digest.
I: Yeah. I'm a web developer. So this isn't part of ýÿ, I'm a web developer.
P: It's really cool going from coding to an actual website and stuff, but it's a lot.
I: It is.
