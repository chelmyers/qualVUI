END OF TASK
BEGIN Q&A
I: okay so just a couple of quick questions before I had to go so what did you think were the capabilities of DiscoverCal after interacting with it right now and why do you think theyre do I know two
P. I know if can do recurring events and then and it can do not just location and time but also who is attending and it can, it can reschedule things change things. edit delete.
I: okay so what what gave you all that information besides just the prompts. Is there somethings like adding people like you said
P: Yeah, um, like yeah I mean it said like a {mental_model_from_menu}{mental_model_UI}box for attendees{/mental_model_UI}{/mental_model_from_menu}, it had. And it also had like a menu on the side that said somethings.
I: Okay, did you look at the menu often or did you find like youre pretty comfortable without it?
P: I looked at the menu to make sure I was getting it right because it had like {att>incorrect_mental_model}Add event but then it made the title the event which seemed odd that it always whatever I said first it would make it the title even if it was the time {/att>incorrect_mental_model}
I: okay and okay. what else do you think were the limitations, you mentioned on thing, what else do you think were the limitations of the interface?
P: it would say is that all?, and I would say yes, thats all, and it wouldnt know what to do with that. So I said Im done and it knew what to do then.
I: How would you say um this compared to like your previous experience with voice interaction? Would you say that it has in any way inform your understanding of how a voice interface works? like how early Siri works or any other sort of voice interaction?
P: {vui_differ}I mean, I assume it works a bit differently because they all work a bit differently.{/vui_differ}
I: So, let me rephrase. Do you think that the approach you took here to get things to work for you is different from the approach that you would take with Siri or another voice interaction system?
P: {menu_useful_for_beginners}{menu_useful}Yeah because usually Im just kind of grabbing at straws, but this one has a menu that I can look at. To figure out what I need to say, and I, like eventually if I use this a lot I wouldnt need it anymore. {/menu_useful}{/menu_useful_for_beginners}{menu_too_much}Im not sure if it can be minimized but if I were using it a lot I would want to eventually be about to minimize it. If I didnt need it I can have more space.{/menu_too_much}
I: Okay, what did you think about having a lot of stuff together in one place as well
P: what do you mean?
I: like a lot of the commands together in one space?
P: {menu_useful}Yeah, I like that because its, its one place to look you dont have to open another window or something{/menu_useful}
I: All right, and besides that, so, what would you say about, how confindenet would you feel, like interacting with DiscoverCal in the same context as Siri? How would you compare?
P: {distrust_NLP}yeah its the same, that I have with any voice interface. That after I say something, its like, Ohhh, it is actually doing to know what I say?{/distrust_NLP} And then sometimes it does and sometimes it doesnt.
I: Did DiscoverCal prefrom as you expected it to?
P: mmhmmm
I: Okay, and how would, does this in any way like sort of um, what is your understanding of voice interface right now like what do you think is for the general capability and limitation? Like generally with voice interface, what are they able to do and not do for you
P:{distrust_NLP} Well they cant understand every like command. {/distrust_NLP}Because I though, I{human_convo_fallback}{att>faith_in_NLP} {guess_command}just kind of guessing with Im done and that worked. I though, like, because it gave the prompt is that all? then thats all works, but it didnt because it doesnt have that command.{/guess_command}{/att>faith_in_NLP}{/human_convo_fallback}
I: Is something like DiscoverCal informing how other interfaces, voice interfaces would work, in a similar situation for you? What do you think Siri would be different in that situation?
P: Um, I dont know.
I: Ok, alright, thats totally fine! I guess we can see in the second session or after interaction with it more if there is a difference in your perception towards how voice interaction in general, like your understanding of the interface, if it changes at all or it not. Do you have any other questions about DiscoverCal? About voice interaction? Allright so that all we need from you today!
