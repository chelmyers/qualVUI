BEGIN Q&A

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½


I: Based on your ... Is there anything you want to say before I ask you any questions.

P: Nope.

I: What was your approach, today. How did you approach the interface?

P: At first, I just wanted to kinda say all of the details at once and hope that it would kind of parse through that.{att>assimilation_bias} I think OKGoogle does that, so that's kind of what I'm used it. {/att>assimilation_bias} But once I realized that the things had to be broken down, that was a lot easier.

I: Okay.

P: So, probably the second time I was like, yeah, okay, I need to tell it to create the event first and then go through all the stuff.

I: Okay. What made you realize that you had to do that?

P: The fact that it set the title of my first event to all of the details.

I: And how did you go about trying to figure out what you should say in order to get the right, sort of, back and forth to happen?

P: The left menu was really helpful.

I: Okay.

P: And then also just the titles above each of the fields that had to be filled out when creating the event.

I: Okay, so based on your interaction today, how would you say that this was different than the approach with what you already use? Like OKGoogle?

P: It required a lot more back and forth. Rather than being able to say everything at once, you had to kind of break it down.

I: Okay. 

P: I was also unsure of how to create a recurring event after I said, "Add an event," because I didn't say, "Add a recurring event." But it interpreted the weekly, so that was really nice.

I: Okay, cool. So what did you understand about how Discover kind of works. How does it function?

P: You've gotta walk it through, kind of the first step, first kind of like you're selecting something out of a menu. And then insert all the details one by one.

I: Okay. And what did you think were its limitations?

P: I think the back and forth is really time consuming.

I: Okay.

P: And I think having it be a lot faster would be something good if I were to use this on a day to day basis. Where I can just kind of say it and then be done.

I: Okay. Did this in any way influence how you understand other voice interfaces work or function in general?

P: I don't think so.

I: So what you understand of how OKGoogle, what does that say?

P: I don't know much about voice recognition at all.

I: Sorry-

P: I'm always just kind of amazed by how they can pick out words from all these different kinds of voices but beyond that ...

I: What is your understanding of how OKGoogle works in the capacity that you've used it in?

P: I usually don't phrase things as questions, and it's still kind of able to figure out what I'm searching for. But I've always kind of interpreted that as more of a Google thing than a voice control thing, because all the voice control does is record what words you're saying and then beyond that the Google search engine takes care of the rest.

I: So for the recording, what words you say aspect, what you think is ... How do you think OKGoogle parses through that aspect?

P: Oh gosh. 

I: Just like sort of you're understanding or your expectation from the interface?

P: My guess is that it breaks down the sound waves, and stuff. I don't know if that's the answer you're looking for?

I: No, It's not about that. It's just sort of understand what you're ... Say for example, if I came to this interface for the first time, and I'm like, I know if I move my mouse, it's going to go left and right, so I'm not gonna move it up and down in the air, right? Because I know that's a limitation of the thing.

I: When you start a voice interface with OKGoogle, you know there's certain things that it will accept, certain things that it won't. That understanding makes you use it a certain way, so what is that understanding of yours with OKGoogle?

P: You've gotta, of course, press the main info button before you start talking. You've gotta make sure you're not in a super crowded room, because then it won't be able to figure out your voice versus everything else that's going on. And just speak, probably, a little more loudly and clearly than usual.

I: Okay. All right. What did you ... Did this interface perform as you expected it to? Whatever your expectation was on the goal.

P: For the most part, with the exception of saying everything at once.

I: Okay.
