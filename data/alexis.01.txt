END OF TASK



BEGIN Q&A




I: Okay awesome, so I just have a few questions for you and then were done.

P: Okay.

I: First question is, based off your usage today what do you think DiscoverCal is capable of?

P: I think its capable of ... just like generally like its purpose?

I: Yes.

P: Okay, allowing people to input events in their calendar based on what the event is, where it is, what day and what time, and youre also able to do recurring events. And then you can view your calendar.

I: Awesome, and again based on your session today what do you think the limitations of DiscoverCal are?

P: Limitations are that its really hard to use. Its hard to use. [laughs] {learn_command}I got the hang of creating a new event, its still a lot more difficult than it could be{/learn_command}, but changing event, I didnt even successfully do that.

I: Yeah.

P: So, I dont even know how you would do that, {distrust_NLP}because it couldnt understand{/distrust_NLP}. So, I think its limitations are definitely usability overall, really tough and then if you cannot use ... {does_not_like_ui}I dont know how that would work to like to go to different months, or different years. Whether you want like a weekly view, or yearly view, I dont really know how you would flip through{/does_not_like_ui}, cause it didnt really show that on the left bar. So, I think its limitations are just being very selective in what language you can use.{vui_differ}{faith_in_NLP} A lot of other voice control things Ive used have been a lot more lenient, so it like kind of understands what youre saying even if you dont word it like verbatim how they want you to.{/faith_in_NLP}{/vui_differ}

I: Yeah. Awesome, you were fantastic at voicing out your thoughts the whole entire time.

P: Okay.

I: It is-

P: Really? Okay.

I: Super valid.

P: Okay I was like Oh my am I not saying enough.

I: No, no, no, you were doing good. Also the facial expressions were my favorite.

P: I was gonna say my facial expressions were probably giving me away.

I: But its perfect, its perfect. Cause we have a vide recording, so we have that, so we can go like ...

P: I was laughing. I was like, "Oh my God."

I: No, no its wonderful. So, I ... lets go back to the issue we were having with modify.

P: Yes.

I: What do you think was the main problem the system was having there?

P: It didnt ... it kept not recognizing what event I was talking about, so I would say, "Edit math meeting." And so theres no event called
