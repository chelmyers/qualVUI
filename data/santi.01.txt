BEGIN Q&A

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½



I: Okay, so before I let you go, just some quick questions. 

P: Okay.

I: What was your approach? Like what did you start off ...

{att>assimilation_bias}P: At the beginning, I used it as if I was using Alexa, just trying to say like a natural language sentence, like a freeform sentence. Then the first event ... Oh, sorry ...

I: No, it's fine, you can keep talking. 

P: The first event was a bit bumpy, because I was trying to do that, and then I got myself into a corner that I created that event with a very long name, and I couldn't get out of that. When I realized that, when I canceled everything went better. Then I think it was maybe in the third event, when I realized that these patterns were actually working, so these patterns were with fillers that I could just change, like the date, the time, and then when I used that for the last, I think it was the two last ones, then everything worked fine.{/att>assimilation_bias}

I: Okay. What was your understanding of how DiscoverCal works or what it's capabilities were?

P: Well, I only had to add and modify events, did I really? Yeah, I ... No, I did not.

I: Yeah, just from this session and your understanding of what you've done so far.

P: {att>faith_in_NLP}It would let me create and modify event in my calendar without me having to use a keyboard or a mouse, something like that. I guess the main advantage of this voice interface is, in general, to me, what I see, when I'm in front of the computer, I might never use it, but I see it as very useful at home, when you are actually doing things.{/att>faith_in_NLP}

I: Yeah, DiscoverCal is actually made for wall mount display at home, we're testing in a lab because of our limitations. My question is more, what is your understanding of what is your mental model of what this interface is doing, or what it does?

P: What is my mental model?

I: Or how it works? I'm using that phrase because I know you'll understand.

P: {att>correct_mental_model}Right. What I see, or what I think it does now is, so there's a set of commands that I can give, and each one has a pattern. Basically, if I say a sentence that matches any of these patterns, then that command will be executed. At the beginning I was trying to be more freeform, and then that didn't work. If I follow these commands, and I guess if I were to use this for several days and I memorized these commands, it would be, I think, fairly intuitive and very easy to use.{/att>correct_mental_model}

I: You mentioned that if you were to memorize the commands, so would you want it to always be their nature as well?

P: Most likely, once you've used it enough you don't need it, so that should be optional. It should be something that is easy to pull, because at least in my first session it was. When I realized that I had to use them, then it was extremely useful.

I: Okay. Besides that, what did you think were the limitations of the interface?

P: The limitations of the interface ... There's a couple of limitations that I can think of because of the template manner. I don't know if there's any way to get around it with the current thing. For example, imagine that I made a little typo in the name and I wanted to change the name, I would not be able to say, "Change that T to an R," because it would not understand that command. Those kind of things that with a keyboard, I would do very quickly. Let's see, any other ... Then there was that problem I had in the first event, that I drove myself into a corner because I created an event with an enormous title that I would never be able to reproduce to refer to that event. I wonder if there would be any way to refer to events, to delete the event of Wednesday at 6:00 without having to use the title of the event, because I set a ridiculous title that I would never be able to change.

I: Okay. 

I: My last question is does this in any way sort of influence or inform your understanding of how voice interfaces themselves work? Like generally voice interaction?

P: {att>assimilation_bias}I'm actually quite familiar with how like Siri and Alexa and those things work internally, so I have to say I don't think so, because I do know that they work with this kind of templates except they Alexa and Siri, they have like thousands, or potential thousands of patterns. And this one had like, I don't, 12 or 10, right. So I did know that it worked like that, and what I was wondering if you guys were tapping into some of those services and that's why at the beginning I was freeform, but it just confirms.{/att>assimilation_bias}

I: Okay. Okay. Cool, yeah.
