BEGIN Q&A
˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ˝ˇ


I: So, just about your interaction today, can you tell me what you thought the system now capable of doing 
differently, from what it was capable of doing last session?

P: I think that it understood me a little bit better except for that last ... It had a hard time understanding me 
then. But, there wasn't really any sort ... {att>blame_self}If I made a mistake, I found it was easier on picking up on that.{/att>blame_self} I 
don't know. Yeah, it seemed a little bit easier than last time. I can't really say how though. I couldn't say if I-

I: Okay. What do you think was ... Did you change anything in your approach towards the interface?

P: I don't think so, because the interface seems like maybe the voice recognition was improved maybe, 
because the only real issue last time was just the fact, that it couldn't hear me sometimes. But now it's a bit 
better, I think.

I: Okay. So, one thing you should know is that we haven't changed anything in the system from last session 
to now, and we're basically just conducting-

P: Okay.

I: Sessions with the exact same interface. The only difference is that we give you a different set of tasks to 
do that add-on a little more stuff to it, and also we just want to see if your approach towards the interface 
changes ... Interacting with something with voice over time for example. So, do you think that anything 
changed given that you had a first session, and the second session? Did you think anything changed in sort 
of, your approach, your confidence, your sort of like comfort level?

P: I think, I was little bit more {att>confident}confident{/att>confident} now that I've used it once before, because I kind of understood how it 
worked. I used it one time and now I kind of like okay, I know how this works. Let me do it, keep doing it 
basically the same way but ... I obviously didn't have to invite people to the events but, I felt pretty confident 
that it would be able to do it. {att>blame_nlp}The voice recognition thing aside, I was like, okay well, I can probably do that til 
this I say and just go and say what's this one card{/att>blame_nlp}…

I: Okay. So, was it the fact it give you prompt, that made you think that it can do this, or was it something in 
the system that made you think that you can do this?

P: Well, I actually'd not seen that option before.

I: Okay.

P: So, I actually didn't realize that but, the fact that it can do {att>delighted}that is pretty cool.{/att>delighted}

I: Okay. All right. And, besides that, so I'm unsure what your experience with the voice interface prior is.

P: {att>assimilation_bias}I have used Siri sometimes. I don't have an iphone anymore, but now I use Google Assistant sometimes.{/att>assimilation_bias}

I: Okay.

P: And I do actually use ... I don't know if this is the same thing, it might not be. I use voice in text a lot when 
I can't type on my phone. 

I: Okay. All right. Yeah. That counts. Absolutely. So, based on your prior experience with voice interface, do 
you think that you took some approach specific to carry out the tasks here, that you use there or do you think 
that ...

P: Kind of, in that you seem like a prefix to do the thing that I want so I'll create an event. But, I think that 
there's actually ... I would use Google Assistant sometimes for this Google app. I don't know if you've 
heard of that. They have Google Assistant within-

I: Okay.

P: The app and also now they have it on Android

I: Okay.

P: And I use the Allo version of it to set events, and it was so annoying. There's always extra words included, 
or it set the time at 2 A.M. as opposed to 2 P.M.

I: Okay.

P: {att>faith_in_NLP}And that was not ... I don't like using that, and I wanted it to work but it didn't. And, I feel like this would be 
a more powerful version of it, and a better version of it, because it actually can do what I want it to do, not 
put set alarm at 2 A.M. I don't want that.{/att>faith_in_NLP}

I: Okay. All right. So, based on this interaction, has it changed the way that you would interact with ... So, I 
understand that you did have a certain approach when you started to interact with the interface, you think 
your interaction here would change the way that you interact with a voice interface in the future?

P: I think so. I think that more than anything, it would just influence me to use it more. I would.. I've said this before but I would like to use this app once. I have a calender app so, ... but just doesn't have voice interface and I would want that.

I: Okay. But, just say if you were using Google Assistant, is there something about your approach, that you 
took here but you would use for that, if at all?

P: I don't think so. I feel like this is more dedicated specifically to calender things, which is good because I 
actually like using ... I have, like I said, I use calender apps. I probably would not really integrate this into my 
calender app or the Google Assistant, because Google Assistant is more of just to search things. But, yeah, 
I don't think it would change much.

I: Okay. And, what do you think about your general understanding of voice interface after this interaction?

P: {att>correct_mental_model}I think that it is ... I understand it a bit more, because I have more experience with it for sure. Definitely, 
how the prefixes work and what ... I feel like it has an easy time understanding me once I say a prefix. It'll 
just say what I want it to learn, write down whatever, or add an event. I feel like it definitely improved my 
understanding of it, I should say.{/att>correct_mental_model}

I: Okay. All right. That's basically it. You have anything else you want add about the session, about 
DiscoverCal?

P: I don't think so. I do like ... I will say three or four times, I do want DiscoverCal to be an app personally 
because I have a business calender app for Android, which is a good calender app for definitely the voice 
interface would be very helpful… that or just have this app …That'd be 
cool.
